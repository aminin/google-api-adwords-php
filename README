AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API PHP Client Library
================================================================

Google's AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API services lets developers
design computer programs that interact directly with the AdWords and DoubleClick
Ad Exchange Buyer platforms. With these applications, advertisers and third
parties can more efficiently -- and creatively -- manage their large or complex
AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer accounts and campaigns.

The AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API PHP Client Library makes it
easy to write PHP clients to programmatically access AdWords and DoubleClick Ad
Exchange Buyer accounts. All client library classes and utilities are in the
directory or sub-directory of "src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/".

The client library is compatible with all standard PHP 5.2.x and 5.3.x
distributions. The library uses the native SoapClient class
[http://us3.php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php], which needs to be enabled with the
--enable-soap flag if building PHP from source. More information about
compatibility can be found in the PHP Compatibility section of this README.

The complete documentation for AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API is
available from http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/developer/index.html.


What's in the client library?
-----------------------------

The client library provides full access to all the functionality of the
AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API web services plus more. It
includes:

  - Data classes: The client library provides all the necessary data classes.
    For example, it provides the Campaign data class for encapsulating campaign
    data. These classes are generated automatically from WSDLs.

  - AdWordsUser class: The AdWordsUser class provides methods for setting
    credentials for accessing AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer accounts
    as well as for creating instances of the AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange
    Buyer Service classes.

  - Helpful utilities: The utilities located under
    "src/Google/Api/Ads/Common/Util" help you manage XML and import
    images into the client library.

  - Logger class: This class provides simple methods for logging the SOAP XML
    messages of all requests and responses.

  - Examples: The PHP client library comes with code examples in the
    "examples/" directory. We encourage you to use code examples to get started
    writing your own application. All the code examples are runnable out of the
    box, but you will have to set your credentials in
    "src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/auth.ini" and you may be required to
    insert object IDs in where you see "INSERT_***_HERE".


Basic usage
-----------

For those of you who have already built PHP clients without using the client
library, the AdWordsUser class has methods for setting username, password,
client customer ID, application token, developer token, and useragent so that
you don't have to write the code to set the request headers. The methods for
creating new instances of service classes takes the place of the code for
instantiating the stubs that connect to the web services.

In the following example, for using the default constructor,

  $user = new AdWordsUser();

the credentials are loaded from the "src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/auth.ini" file.

The credentials can also be loaded in one of two ways: supplying an alternative
authentication INI file or supplying credentials via the constructor's
parameters.

If an authentication INI file is provided and successfully loaded, those
values will be used unless a corresponding parameter overwrites it.
If the authentication INI file is not provided (e.g. it is null)
the class will attempt to load the default authentication file at the path
of "../auth.ini" relative to this file's directory. Any corresponding parameter,
which is not null will however, overwrite any parameter loaded from the default
INI.

  $user = new AdWordsUser(NULL, $email, $password, $developerToken,
      $applicationToken, $userAgent, $clientId);

  or

  // Used if the account is not using the MCC to log in.
  $user = new AdWordsUser(NULL, $email, $password, $developerToken,
      $applicationToken, $userAgent);


How do I start?
---------------

Depending on your PHP setup, you will need to extract this library into a
directory on your system which is secure and has read/execute permissions to the
user executing this library.

There is no need to worry about accessing the WSDLs for the web services;
the classes in the client library do it for you. Demo programs in "examples/"
directory can be used to get started writing your own client. They should work
out of the box if you provide the right credentials; the default behavior is to
use credentials from "../auth.ini" relative to the
AdWordsUser.php file's directory.

To write a program that accesses AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer
accounts using the client library, do the following:

  1) Set the include path and the require the folowing PHP file:

     // You can set the include path to src directory or reference
     // AdWordsUser.php directly via require_once.
     // $path = '/path/to/pda_api_php_lib/src';
     $path = dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../src';
     set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . $path);

     require_once 'Google/Api/Ads/AdWordsUser/Lib/AdWordsUser.php';

  2) Create an AdWordsUser instance, specifying the credentials at
     creation time. Or, you can use the default constructor after completing
     the INI file as described above.

     $user = new AdWordsUser(NULL, $email, $password, $developerToken,
         $applicationToken, $userAgent, $clientId);

  3) Optionally, enable logging to capture the content of the requests and
     responses. This example sends the information to a file:

     $user->LogDefaults();

  4) Instantiate the desired service class by calling the getXService method on
     the AdWordsUser instance. Getting the service will "require"
     the proper PHP file, so that all classes needed for that service
     will be loaded.

     $campaignService =
         $user->getCampaignService('v200909', 'https://adwords.google.com');

     or

     // Defaults to parameters above.
     $campaignService = $user->GetCampaignService();

     or

     // Uses the sandbox environment.
     $campaignService =
         $user->GetCampaignService('v200909',
             'https://adwords-sandbox.google.com');

  5) Create data objects and invoke methods on the service class instance. The
     data objects and methods map directly to the data objects and requests for
     the corresponding web service.

     // Create new campaign structure.
     $campaign = new Campaign();
     $campaign->name = 'Campaign #' . time();
     $campaign->status = 'ACTIVE';
     $campaign->biddingStrategy = new ManualCPC();
     $campaign->budget = new Budget('DAILY', new Money(50000000), 'STANDARD');

     $operation = new CampaignOperation();
     $operation->operand = $campaign;
     $operation->operator = 'ADD';
     $operations[] = $operation;

     // Add campaign.
     $campaignReturnValue = $campaignService->mutate($operations);


Running the examples
---------------------

Examples can be run by executing the following on command line
from a sub-directory of the "examples/" directory,

  $ php Example.php


Running in the sandbox environment
----------------------------------

It is recommended that during development of your library, you use the sandbox
envinroment:

  http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/adwords_api_sandbox.html

To run in this enviroment, you can make one of two changes to your library:

  1) Change the default server (DEFAULT_SERVER) in the settings.ini file,
     located at "src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/settings.ini", to
     "https://adwords-sandbox.google.com" and then instantiate all service
     clients with no parameters i.e.

     // Defaults to parameters set in the settings INI file.
     $campaignService = $user->GetCampaignService();

  2) Include the sandbox server in all service client instantiations i.e.

     // Uses the sandbox environment.
     $campaignService =
         $user->GetCampaignService('v200909',
             'https://adwords-sandbox.google.com');


Authentication Options
----------------------

Authentication in the client library is handled by the AdWordsUser object, which
has the following options.

  - Email and Password: The email and password of the AdWords account or MCC
    account is used. When the first service is created an AuthToken is generated
    using the ClientLogin API using these credentials. The email and
    password can be be stored in the auth.ini file, passed into the AdWordsUser
    constructor, or set individually using the SetEmail() and SetPassword()
    methods. If the AuthToken expires (they are valid for up to two weeks) it
    can be regenerated using the RegenerateAuthToken() method.

  - AuthToken: An existing AuthToken is used. It is recommended to reuse
    AuthTokens since too many requests to the ClientLogin API can lead to
    errors.  You can pass the authToken in the contructor or set it using the
    SetAuthToken() method.

  - OAuth: The OAuth protocol is used. This protocol provides a way to access
    an AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer account without needing
    possesion of the email or password. Instead a permanent OAuth token is
    requested, authorized by the user in their browser, and then upgraded for
    full access. The AdWordsUser provides the RequestOAuthToken(),
    GetOAuthAuthorizationUrl(), and UpgradeOAuthToken() methods to help simplify
    the process. Existing OAuth tokens can be used by passing them into the
    contructor or by using the SetOAuthInfo() method. See the example
    UseOAuth.php for an example of how to use these methods.


How do I enable logging?
------------------------

The client library uses a custom class for all logging purposes and is exposed
through the Logger.php file. There are two loggers within this class described
below.

  - REQUEST_INFO_LOG: Logs all requests from the client library along
    with information such as the timestamp, email, service, method,
    request Id, response time and which server was used. The default
    behavior is to log this information to "logs/request_info.log" relative to
    your project's home directory.

  - SOAP_XML_LOG: Logs all incoming and outgoing SOAP requests/responses. The
    default behavior is to log this information to "logs/soap_xml.log" relative
    to your project's home directory. Sensitive information, such as
    authentication tokens, will be stripped.

Logging can be enabled using the following methods.

  - $user->LogDefaults(): Logs request information for all requests, but only
    logs SOAP XML for requests that resulted in an error.

  - $user->LogErrors(): Only logs request information and SOAP XML for requests
    that resulted in an error.

  - $user->LogAll(): Logs request information and SOAP XML for all requests.

You can use the methods of the Logger class directly for even more control over
how requests are logged.


Encoding special characters
---------------------------

The AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API requires that all requests are
UTF-8 encoded. Because UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII, alphanumeric
and punctuation characters from other ASCII based encodings (such as ISO 8859-1
or Windows-1252) are compatible and don't request any conversion. However, many
special characters are not compatible between encodings and need to be manually
converted before being passed in to the client library. This can be done using
the PHP function iconv().

For example, to convert a Windows-1252 encoded string containing the euro sign
to UTF-8 you could use the following code:

  $price = iconv('WINDOWS-1252', 'UTF-8', '€40');

Alternatively you can choose to represent the special characters as XML
character entities. For example, the euro sign (€) is represented as the XML
entity "&#x20AC;". The format of the XML entity is "&#x" followed by the Unicode
hex code point for the character. You can look up the code point for a given
character using the charts on unicode.org (http://www.unicode.org/charts/).

The PHP SoapClient class, and hence the PHP client library, assumes
that the values passed in to the services are unescaped and will
automatically escape them. For XML entities like the one above this can have
the unintended consequence of escaping the ampersand, breaking the entity. To
work around this issue we recommend that you use the PHP function
html_entity_decode() to to unescape these entities before passing them in to
the client library.

For example, to unescape a string containing the XML character entity for
the euro sign to a UTF-8 string you could use the following code:

  $price = html_entity_decode('&#x20AC;40', ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');


Error messages about Timezones
------------------------------

If you are getting warnings about setting your default timezone, you will
need to do so in your php.ini file setting the field:

  date.timezone=America/Los_Angeles

More information is available here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php


Already defined classes
-----------------------

Since PHP 5.2 does not have namespaces, there is the possibility that one
of the automatically generated classes used by the API has the same name as an
existing class in your environment. Classes that were found to conflict with
PHP native classes have already been renamed:

  'DateTime' => 'AdWordsDateTime'
  'Target' => 'AdWordsTarget'

If you find that there are additional conflicts in your environment you have
the following options:

  1) Rename the class in the corresponding *Service.php file and update the
     mapping in *Service::$classmap to reference the new class name. Be aware
     that the same type can be defined in multiple services.

  2) Rename the conflicting class in your system. This will likely not be
     possible if the class is part of another library.

  3) Regenerate the classes from the WSDLs using pseudo-namespace support. See
     the section "Pseudo-namespace support" for more information.


Pseudo-namespace support
------------------------

Pseudo-namespaces can be used to help avoid class or function name conflicts
due to PHP 5.2's lack of native namespace support. This involves prepending
all class names with a unique string. When generating classes from the WSDLs
you have the option to enable pseudo-namespaces, so for example the type
"Campaign" would produce a class called "GoogleApiAdsAdWords_Campaign".

For the sake of backwards compatibility this feature is not enabled by default.
It can be enabled by setting wsdl2php.enablePseudoNamespaces to "true" in the
build.properties file and running the "generate" target in build.xml. This
requires the source build of the library.

Enabling pseudo-namespaces for an existing application make cause your code to
break, as class names have changed. To avoid this you should use the following
practices when writing your application:

  - Instead of calling the constructor directly, use the service's Create()
    method to construct new objects. This method only requires that you enter
    the original type name, and it takes an optional array or parameters which
    can be flat or associative.

      $keyword1 = $service->Create('Keyword');
      $keyword2 = $service->Create('Keyword', array('mars', 'BROAD'));
      $keyword3 = $service->Create('Keyword',
          array('text' => 'jupiter', 'matchType' => 'BROAD'));

  - Instead of using "instanceof" to determine the type of an object returned
    by the API, test the value of its *Type field. All classes that extend
    a base class have this field available.

      if ($criterion->CriterionType == 'Keyword') { ... }


PHP Suhosin Patch
-----------------

With some PHP installations, it has been found that the Suhosin patch prevents
correct usage of the AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API PHP Client
Library. It is believed that the patch is catching memory leaks caused by an
underlying library, but we are still investigating the root cause. Errors caught
by the Suhosin patch may look like the following:

  ALERT - canary mismatch on efree() - heap overflow detected
  (attacker 'REMOTE_ADDR not set', file '...', line ...)

At this time we recommend using versions of PHP that do not have the Suhosin
patch applied. More information about the Suhosin patch can be found here:

  http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/index.html

Note: this patch is applied by default to many standard distributions, including
the current Ubuntu distribution - 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.7.
