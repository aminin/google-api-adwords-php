AdWords API PHP Client Library
==============================

Google's AdWords API service lets developers design computer programs that
interact directly with the AdWords platform. With these applications,
advertisers and third parties can more efficiently -- and creatively -- manage
their large or complex AdWords accounts and campaigns.

The AdWords API PHP Client Library makes it easy to write PHP
clients to programmatically access AdWords accounts. All client
library classes and utilities are in the directory or sub-directory of
"src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/".

The client library is compatible with all standard PHP 5.2.x distributions. The
library uses the native SoapClient class
[http://us3.php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php], which needs to be enabled with the
--enable-soap flag if building PHP from source. More information about
compatibility can be found in the PHP Compatibility section of thise README.

The complete documentation for AdWords API is available from
http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/developer/index.html.


What's in the client library?
-----------------------------

The client library provides full access to all the functionality of the
AdWords API web services plus more. It includes:

  - Data classes: The client library provides all the necessary data classes.
    For example, it provides the Campaign data class for encapsulating campaign
    data. These classes are generated automatically from WSDLs.

  - AdWordsUser class: The AdWordsUser class provides methods for setting
    credentials for accessing AdWords accounts as well as for creating
    instances of the AdWords Service classes.

  - Helpful utilities: The utilities located under
    "src/Google/Api/Ads/Common/Util" help you manage XML and import
    images into the client library.

  - Logger class: This class provides simple methods for logging the SOAP XML
    messages of all requests and responses.

  - Examples: The PHP client library comes with code examples in the
    "examples/" directory. We encourage you to use code examples to get started
    writing your own application. All the code examples are runnable out of the
    box, but you will have to set your credentials in
    "src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/auth.ini" and you may be required to
    insert object IDs in where you see "INSERT_***_HERE".


Basic usage
-----------

For those of you who have already built PHP clients without
using the client library, the AdWords class has methods for
setting username, password, client ID (clientEmail or clientCustomerId),
application token, developer token, and useragent so that you
don't have to write the code to set the request headers. The methods for
creating new instances of service classes takes the place of the code
for instantiating the stubs that connect to the web services.

In the following example, for using the default constructor,

  $user = new AdWordsUser();

the credentials are loaded from the "src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/auth.ini" file.

The credentials can also be loaded in one of two ways: supplying an alternative
authentication INI file or supplying credentials via the constructor's
parameters.

If an authentication INI file is provided and successfully loaded, those
values will be used unless a corresponding parameter overwrites it.
If the authentication INI file is not provided (e.g. it is null)
the class will attempt to load the default authentication file at the path
of "../auth.ini" relative to this file's directory. Any corresponding parameter,
which is not null will however, overwrite any parameter loaded from the default
INI.

  $user = new AdWordsUser(NULL, $email, $password, $developerToken,
      $applicationToken, $userAgent, $clientId);

  or

  // Used if the account is not using the MCC to log in.
  $user = new AdWordsUser(NULL, $email, $password, $developerToken,
      $applicationToken, $userAgent);


How do I start?
---------------

Depending on your PHP setup, you will need to extract this library into a
directory on your system which is secure and has read/execute permissions to the
user executing this library.

There is no need to worry about accessing the WSDLs for the web services;
the classes in the client library do it for you. Demo programs in "examples/"
directory can be used to get started writing your own client. They should work
out of the box if you provide the right credentials; the default behavior is to
use credentials from "../auth.ini" relative to the
AdWordsUser.php file's directory.

To write a program that accesses AdWords accounts using the client library, do
the following:

  1) Set the include path and the require the folowing PHP file:

     // You can set the include path to src directory or reference
     // AdWordsUser.php directly via require_once.
     // $path = '/path/to/pda_api_php_lib/src';
     $path = dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../src';
     set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . $path);

     require_once 'Google/Api/Ads/AdWordsUser/Lib/AdWordsUser.php';

  2) Create an AdWordsUser instance, specifying the credentials at
     creation time. Or, you can use the default constructor after completing
     the INI file as described above.

     $user = new AdWordsUser(NULL, $email, $password, $developerToken,
         $applicationToken, $userAgent, $clientId);

  3) Optionally, enable logging to capture the content of the requests and
     responses. This example sends the information to a file:

     $user->LogDefaults();

  4) Instantiate the desired service class by calling the getXService method on
     the AdWordsUser instance. Getting the service will "require"
     the proper PHP file, so that all classes needed for that service
     will be loaded.

     $campaignService =
         $user->getCampaignService('v200909', 'https://adwords.google.com');

     or

     // Defaults to parameters above.
     $campaignService = $user->GetCampaignService();

     or

     // Uses the sandbox environment.
     $campaignService =
         $user->GetCampaignService('v200909',
             'https://adwords-sandbox.google.com');

  5) Create data objects and invoke methods on the service class instance. The
     data objects and methods map directly to the data objects and requests for
     the corresponding web service.

     // Create new campaign structure.
     $campaign = new Campaign();
     $campaign->name = 'Campaign #' . time();
     $campaign->status = 'ACTIVE';
     $campaign->biddingStrategy = new ManualCPC();
     $campaign->budget = new Budget('DAILY', new Money(50000000), 'STANDARD');

     $operation = new CampaignOperation();
     $operation->operand = $campaign;
     $operation->operator = 'ADD';
     $operations[] = $operation;

     // Add campaign.
     $campaignReturnValue = $campaignService->mutate($operations);


Running the examples
---------------------

Examples can be run by executing the following on command line
from a sub-directory of the "examples/" directory,

  $ php Example.php


Running in the sandbox environment
----------------------------------

It is recommended that during development of your library, you use the sandbox
envinroment:

  http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/adwords_api_sandbox.html

To run in this enviroment, you can make one of two changes to your library:

  1) Change the default server (DEFAULT_SERVER) in the settings.ini file,
     located at "src/Google/Api/Ads/AdWords/settings.ini", to
     "https://adwords-sandbox.google.com" and then instantiate all service
     clients with no parameters i.e.

     // Defaults to parameters set in the settings INI file.
     $campaignService = $user->GetCampaignService();

  2) Include the sandbox server in all service client instantiations i.e.

     // Uses the sandbox environment.
     $campaignService =
         $user->GetCampaignService('v200909',
             'https://adwords-sandbox.google.com');


How do I enable logging?
------------------------

The client library uses a custom class for all logging purposes and is exposed
through the Logger.php file. There are two loggers within this class described
below. To quickly begin logging, simply insert this line into your code:

  // Enable default logging behavior.
  $user->LogDefaults();

This invokes the default behavior as described below:

  - SOAP_XML_LOG: Logs all incoming and outgoing SOAP requests/responses. The
    default behavior is to log this information to "logs/soap_xml.log" relative
    to your project's home directory. Sensitive information, such as
    authentication tokens, will be stripped.

  - REQUEST_INFO_LOG: Logs all requests from the client library along
    with information such as the timestamp, email, service, method,
    request Id, response time and which server was used. The default
    behavior is to log this information to "logs/request_info.log" relative to
    your project's home directory.


Error messages about Timezones
------------------------------

If you are getting warnings about setting your default timezone, you will
need to do so in your php.ini file setting the field:

  date.timezone=America/Los_Angeles

More information is available here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php


Already defined classes
-----------------------

Since PHP 5.2.x does not have namespaces, you may find that some classes
are already defined in the service files. Some classes have been renamed already
to prevent conflicts with the native PHP library, those have been prepended
with AdWords*, such as AdWordsDateTime.

You may run into two separate problems:

  1) You discover that a class used by the API is not being defined correctly,
     i.e. you are receiving errors while performing SOAP requests. In this case,
     you may have defined a class with a similar name already. To remedy this,
     navigate the correct *Service.php file depending on the version and service
     name to find a class that you may have defined previously. You can then
     rename the class and modify the classmap array as well. Alternatively, you
     can modify the build.xml file (particularly the "service.classmap"
     property), to avoid using this class name.

  2) You are getting errors that a class cannot be declared more than once. In
     this case, you may be declaring a class after instantiating the service.
     Your options are to rename the problematic API class, as shown above, or to
     rename your local class in your software.

Below is a list of API changes for this library:

  'DateTime' => 'AdWordsDateTime',
  'Target' => 'AdWordsTarget',


PHP Suhosin Patch
-----------------

With some PHP installations, it has been found that the Suhosin patch prevents
correct usage of the AdWords API PHP Client Library. It is believed that the
patch is catching memory leaks caused by an underlying library, but we are
still investigating the root cause. Errors caught by the Suhosin patch may
look like the following:

  ALERT - canary mismatch on efree() - heap overflow detected
  (attacker 'REMOTE_ADDR not set', file '...', line ...)

At this time we recommend using versions of PHP that do not have the Suhosin
patch applied. More information about the Suhosin patch can be found here:

  http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/index.html

Note: this patch is applied by default to many standard distributions, including
the current Ubuntu distribution - 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.7.
